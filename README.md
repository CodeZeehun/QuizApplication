# Quiz Application 
A Simple Quiz Application (Vanilla JS). 

# Introduction
This application is written in `Javascript`. 

Credits to - https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync which I'm using for accepting keyboard input from the user in the terminal.

# Currently Implemented Features 
- Able to run in VSC ``Visual Studio Code`` terminal when debugged using ``Node.JS``.

- Four `quiz categories` to choose from.

- Each category contains 5 MCQ `Multiple Choice Questions`.

- Once the last question (question-5) is answered, the program displays a `summary page` which shows all answers given by the users. 

- The user is allowed to `submit the quiz` or to go back to `retry any of the 5 questions`.

- A `navigation` function e.g. Enter `P` to go to previous question, `N` to go to next question (meaning user can choose to skip the question being displayed and come back to answer later).
